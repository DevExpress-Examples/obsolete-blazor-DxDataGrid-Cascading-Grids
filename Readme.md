### Blazor Data Grid - How to create cascading grids

The Data Grid was moved to maintenance support mode. No new features/capabilities will be added to this component. We recommend that you [migrate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403162/grid/migrate-from-data-grid-to-grid) to the [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403143/grid) component. 

This example illustrates how to create two DxDataGrids for Blazor, handle the *SelectedDataRowChanged* event of the "Master" grid and bind the "Detail" grid based on the selected "Master" grid's row.
